# SolScore - FPL-Based Web3 Prediction Platform Documentation

### Overview
SolScore is a Web3 prediction platform that integrates Fantasy Premier League (FPL) data with blockchain technology, allowing users to stake cryptocurrency on real-time football events and earn rewards based on their FPL performance.

Built on the Solana blockchain, SolScore creates a novel prediction market where users can leverage their fantasy football knowledge to earn crypto rewards, combining fantasy sports' excitement with decentralised finance's financial opportunities.

### Core Architecture
SolScore is built around four primary program modules that work together to create a seamless user experience:

#### 1. FPL Manager Program

Verifies and connects to users' FPL IDs
Synchronizes team data between FPL and SolScore
Processes weekly score updates from the official FPL API
Maintains real-time data integration with the Fantasy Premier League ecosystem

#### 2. Stake Program

Enables users to create stake positions using SOL.
Manages deposit and withdrawal functions.
Creates and maintains stake Program Derived Accounts (PDAs).
Enforces strategic lock periods and early withdrawal penalties.
Tracks stake amounts and durations for reward calculations.

#### 3. Reward Program

Implements complex algorithms to calculate performance-based rewards
Manages the distribution of rewards to qualifying users
Handles reward pool operations and maintenance
Processes reward claims according to protocol rules

#### 4. System Treasury Program

Manages all protocol fees and revenue streams
Controls vault operations for protocol sustainability
Maintains protocol reserves to ensure platform stability
Handles revenue distribution according to governance parameters

### Current Functionality
The initial release of SolScore provides the following features:

Wallet integration for connecting Solana wallets
FPL ID import and verification system
The staking mechanism for placing bets on football events
Reward distribution based on real-time event outcomes
Scheduled un-staking with defined withdrawal periods
Fee and penalty system for early withdrawals.

#### Technical Implementation
SolScore leverages Solana's high-performance blockchain to ensure:

#### Low transaction fees
Near-instant finality
Scalable infrastructure for a large user base
Secure on-chain settlement of rewards

The platform utilizes Program Derived Accounts (PDAs) to maintain state and ensure secure, deterministic account creation and management.
